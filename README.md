## **Colour Scheme**

The colours selected for this site were yellow(`color: #FFF200;`), white(`color: #FFFFFF;`) and black(`color: #000000;`). These colours were selected to incorparate a minimalist design and invoke a "mind the gap" feeling, which informs the user on the close the gap theme of this site.

Additionally, the results meter featured at the end of the quiz has alternate colours `color; #009578;`, and `color: #004033;` both of which are cyan variants. The purpose of this colour selection is to have the results meter stand out on the page and attract the users attention.
